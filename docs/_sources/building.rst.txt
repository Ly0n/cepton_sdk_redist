Building
========

CMake
-----

The simplest way to include the SDK is as a CMake subdirectory:

.. code:: cmake

    add_subdirectory(<cepton_sdk_source_dir>)

    ...

    target_link_libraries(<target> cepton_sdk::cepton_sdk)

See :doc:`samples/cmake`.

Manually
--------

It is also possible to manually link to the SDK as follows:

1. Add the ``cepton_sdk_redist/include`` path.
2. Link to the correct library binary in ``cepton_sdk_redist/lib`` or ``cepton_sdk_redist/bin``.
3. If statically linking, define ``CEPTON_SDK_STATIC``.

Windows
-------

.. note::
	
	It is not possible to statically link in debug mode, since the library does not ship with debug symbols.
